    <h2>Here you can learn all about the <em>raw cat food diet</em> that I am making and feeding to my cat Sawyer. 
  </h2>
    <p>The supplement dosage has been pre-approved by my veterinarian, based on my cat's blood work. His blood work was normal at the time. The meat/organs/bones recipe is taken from youtube/google 80/10/5/5/ raw food diet for cats. I did adjust chicken skin to be only 25% of my cat's diet, as we are trying to shred a few pounds, slowly.</p>
    <p> Note: Vitamins DEKA (vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K , Vitamin A are all fat-soluble - this means that it will result in toxicity (overdose) in animal if added beyond normal amount. Animals should get enough of this purely form the raw diet of 80/10/5/5 without any additional supplements.</p>
    <p> Note: Vitamins B, C, and Taurine and Salmon Oil are water-soluble and are safe in excess amounts. Taurine is very important for healthy heart, add in addition to the hearts in recipe as desired. My vet confirmed: they recommend 500mg/taurine a day for cat's deficient in taurine.</p>
  <p class="item-descriptions">Items that I use to make the raw cat food (exluding the meat/supplement part).</p> 
      <ul class="list-color">
          <li>Food Grinder - manual-</li>
          <li>Kitchen Sheers</li>
          <li>Metal Bowl</li>
          <li>Spatula(Silicone)</li>
          <li>Measuring Spoons</li>
          <li>Kitchen Scale</li>
          <li>2 Bowls for eggs</li>
          <li>Cutting boards(2)</li>
      </ul>
  <p class="item-descriptions">Items that I "cook" the raw cat recipe with (2 week supply):</p>
      <ol class="list-color">
          <li>Chicken thighs WITH bones 5.5lb total (will remove 50% of bone and 75% skin when preparing)</li>
          <li>Chicken Hearts 14oz.</li>
          <li>Chicken Livers 7oz. (this is Vitamin A - which is fat-soluable - do not exceed this amount to avoid toxicity)</li>
          <li>Organic Eggs YOLKS ONLY(4)</li>
          <li>Salmon Oil supplement(4 soft gel capsule at 1,000mg/each or 4,000mg) - I also give about 2 extra a week, directly poured on food 1/2 a capsule</li>
          <li>Vitamin B12 supplement(2 powdered capsules ) - I also give about 1 extra a week, directly poured on food 1/6 a capsule</li>
          <li>Taurine powder ( do not NEED if giving hearts, but suggested) I give </li>
          <li>Low Sodium Salt WITH iodine (1.5 teaspoon) this is purely for iodine intake cats do not need salt</li>
          <li> 1-2 cups filtered neutral ph water</li>
          <li> I do not give additional Vitamin E, as suggested in the raw diets, my Salmon Oil had natural vitamin E. Vitamin E is fat-soluble- so you need to be careful as to not cause toxicity </li>
      </ol>
    <p class="item-descriptions">I also add ( all of these are optional):
      <ul class="list-color">
        <li>Miralax (1/4 tsp. 2x/day)</li>
        <li>Salmon Oil, 1/3 capsule every other day (refridgerate the rest of the capsule)</li>
        <li>Vitamin B12, 1/6 every other day</li>
        <li>Taurine powder 1/16 of a teaspoon, every day</li>
        <li>*Will be introducing Psyllium husk, soon, to help with digestion instead of Miralax</li>
      </ul>
    <p> 
        My cat is restoring his gut flora with probiotics and chicken broth. I boil the remaining bones that I set aside from raw diet in water - no salt/spices. Boil until the water becomes white. Toss bones in trash, run broth through strainer to make sure only broth is left over. Give with raw food 1/2x a day - a few table spoons. Good for hydration as well.
        TIP: figure out how many calories you cat needs. Chicken meat (organs included), are about 50/60 calories per 1 oz of food. Use a scale to weight the final raw mixture and scoop into individual ziplock bags. I scoop about 5.7 oz into each, which is roughly 300 calories. My cat used to weigh 15.5 ish lb and is now down to 13.5 lb, this was intentional, as he was overweight (from other non raw food diet).
        You can find how many calories a cat should eat in a day online, if you know your cats weight and age. KITTENS need much MORE food. So do your research.

    <p>This website is a work in progress. I will be adding a step-by-step section of how to make the food/keep in freezer. I will be adding styling to it in the near future, so that it looks more pleasant. I will also update the recipe, with any additional supplements.</p>
